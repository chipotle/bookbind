# Bookbind

A command-line utility for generating EPUB 2 documents

## Overview

Bookbind is a Python utility for generating EPUB files. It takes a directory name as its sole command-line argument and creates an EPUB file of the same name, with an `.epub` extension, in the working directory. It can natively process Markdown and plain text input files (as well as XHTML) and can be configured to call external processors for other input types.
