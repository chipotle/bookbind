# The only required metadata pieces are 'title' and author.' We may need a
# better way to handle all the Dublin Core stuff here like contributors,
# illustrators, etc. It will default to English language and default to
# its own UUID if none is specified. We need a way to handle ISBNs as well
# as the "file-as"/"role" attributes.

# The actual book contents. This will be used to build the manifest and
# the toc.ncx file. If you don't give a title, 'linear=no' is assumed; you
# can specify linear explicitly if you want. (Maybe we can give this a less
# geeky name, too.) An XHTML/HTML file will not be processed by BookBind.
