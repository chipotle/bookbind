# in "Last, First" style as shown below; they will be flipped to First Last
# order when appropriate. If you do not specify a language, the default will
# be English. If you do not specify either a UUID or an ISBN, a UUID will
# automatically be generated.

# The actual book contents. This will be used to build the manifest and
# the toc.ncx file. If you don't give a title, 'linear=no' is assumed; you
# can specify linear explicitly if you want. (Maybe we can give this a less
# geeky name, too.) An XHTML/HTML file will not be processed by BookBind.
